# code-challenge
with this, i will try to become better at programing by making programs (duh)
here are the projects i will make

# 1 - number tools
this will be a collection of scripts that will do things relating to numbers, such as converting temperatures, coverting cyphers such as binary, and calculating the bifurcartion rate of league of legends characters (not really)
planned scripts: general calculator (temperature, area, mass, distance), print factorial of 100, print N numbers of PI, general decoder (binary, morse, hex and more, but some may not be viable for being more complex such as cesar and vigenere)

# 2 - word tools
same thing as above, but with words. i might do this after the next one as words are complicated
planned scripts: fizzbuzz, count stuff (vowels, letters, syllables, words, etc), check if palyndrome, markov chain sentence generator, chatbot (stupid), password generator (i might add more as there is alot i can do with words

# 3 - basic games
a bunch of basic games, no gui yet, sorry. at this point i just want to make sure i know how to deal with data and stuff
planned games: heads or tails, higher or lower, rock paper scissors, tic tac toe, hangman, EXTRA: naval battle (if i feel like im good enough)

# 4 - text adventure game    
a text adventure game, i dont plan to waste too much time in this game but if i feel like it i will study game design to make it enjoyable, not sure though as i want to make a adventure game like candy box, but that would require buttons. eh... maybe i will start studying guis while doing so

# 5 - clock gui app
a clock with an actual gui, will have stuff like a stop watch, an alarm clock, etc. it will be my first actual GUI program, after that i will make a bunch more

# 5.5 - update old stuff?
as a training to make guis i could add a gui to the number tools and word tools. it looks like the best ideia as i dont want to make guis of programs that already exist, as i think they take some time to make. and i dont want to make too much of it
yeah, maybe i will just update the old scripts. i will put the extra features for it here later on, right now i will focus on actually starting to code, as i did not code anything in the time of writing this
 
# 6? - game with graphics
im not sure what game i will make but i know it will have some sort of graphics, probably 2d, if not something like a doom clone

# the future
im not sure if i will have to learn more advanced stuff to make the game with graphics, making games from scratch and learning how to make stuff for everyday use is my mission with this. but im not sure if this path is correct, because maybe i will have to learn more advanced stuff such as data structures and all that stuff. if i will do i will make a update, but as of right now i will just code more until im good enough
